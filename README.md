# FNTManager
FNTManager is a fixed-height pixel font manager that works with `.fnt` files
and font strip images. The app is able to read from and write to both file
formats.

This project was made as the "big homework" for the "Basics of Programmin 3"
course in university for the fall semester of 2024-25.
